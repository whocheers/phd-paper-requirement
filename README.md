**Statement from Advisor:**  
Shan's paper, On Ridesharing Competition and Accessibility: Evidence from Uber, Lyft, and Taxi, has been accepted for publication at WWW 2018 in April. Historically, WWW has had acceptance rates <20%. This paper is the follow-up to work that my former student, Le Chen, published in 2015.  
Shan performed the vast majority of work on this paper. Le provided some code for collecting data from Uber; Shan updated this infrastructure and built new infrastructure for Lyft. Shan performed all the analytical work, including teaching himself about spatial regression models to investigate equitability. Shan wrote the paper, which Alan and I then edited.  
This work has had a huge amount of impact. The dataset was used by the San Francisco County Transportation authority to issue their own report on ridesharing in SF (http://www.sfcta.org/tncstoday). This report has been presented to the mayor and county board of supervisors of SF.
