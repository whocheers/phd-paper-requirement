**Statement from Advisor:**  

> Desheng's paper, "Auditing the Partisanship of Google Search Snippets", was published at The Web Conference 2019 (WWW 2019, formerly known as the World Wide Web Conference). WWW is a top tier venue with acceptance rates lower than 20%. 

> Desheng is first author on the paper, and did the vast majority of the work. The other authors (Shan and Ron) are also my students, and they contributed expertise in data collection and method design, but Desheng actually did all of the data cleaning, analysis, and paper writing (with my input and editing).

> This paper is interesting from a few perspectives. First, it was a labor of love. I pitched the idea for the paper to Desheng because I thought it would be a nice, easy, straightforward study for a first year PhD student. In reality, the study ended up being much, much more complex to complete, and I am proud that Desheng stuck with the project. Second, this paper is a novel contribution to the growing literature around fair, biased, and accountable algorithms. Unlike other work in this area, Desheng's study looks at how document summarization algorithms may misrepresent their source material, and what implications this may have for people. To my knowledge, no other works has asked these sorts of questions about document summarization algorithms before.
